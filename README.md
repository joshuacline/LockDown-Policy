- Easy Group Policy Application Restriction
- Works as a toggle. Run to enable, and again to disable
- When enabled, no new apps can be opened
- Recommended to keep TaskManager open when enabled
- Clears restrictions on reboot (Safeguard to avoid lockout!). However do NOT use if unfamiliar with Group Policy or Application whitelist
